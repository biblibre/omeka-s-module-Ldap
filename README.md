Ldap module for Omeka S
=======================

This tool is an LDAP authentication module for [Omeka S].


Installation
------------

The module requires the php extension "[php-ldap]" to be installed on the server.
Furthermore, it requires the version 7.3 or higher for php.

The module uses an external library [laminas/ldap], so use the release zip to
install it, or use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [Ldap.zip] from the list of releases (the master does
not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development:

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `Ldap`, and go to the root module, and run:

```sh
cd /path/to/omeka-s/modules
git clone https://github.com/biblibre/omeka-s-module-Ldap.git Ldap
cd Ldap
composer install --no-dev
```

Then install it like any other Omeka module.


Configuration
-------------

LDAP servers configuration should be done in Omeka S main config file "config/local.config.php".

See https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-authentication/adapter/ldap/

Example:

```php
<?php
return [
    'ldap' => [
        'adapter_options' => [
            'server1' => [
                'host' => 'localhost',
                'username' => 'CN=admin,DC=example,DC=com',
                'password' => '*******',
                'bindRequiresDn' => true,
                'baseDn' => 'OU=People,DC=example,DC=com',
                'accountFilterFormat' => '(&(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=%s))',
                'accountCanonicalForm' => 4,
                'accountDomainName' => 'example.com',
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```


Usage
-----

When a user is authenticated, a user is created inside the database with the
role defined in the config form. Once created, an administrator can update the
role.


Development
-----------

When a user is created during the first connection, the events `ldap.user.create.pre`
and `ldap.user.create.post` are triggered so the user can be updated by another
module before flushing.

The ldap user data are cached in user settings (`ldap_identity`).


TODO
----

- [ ] Manage the mapping of roles.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online [issues].
